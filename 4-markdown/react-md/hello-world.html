    <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>
    <pre class="text"><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;,
  document.getElementById(&#39;root&#39;)
);</code></pre>
    <p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.</p>

      In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements
      and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from
      small reusable pieces.

        This guide is designed for people who prefer

      This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React
      concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation
      sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the
      navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your
      screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier
      chapters.
      <strong
        >You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide
        chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.</strong

      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html"

      is the next chapter after this one.

      React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic
      understanding of the JavaScript language.
      <strong>If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend</strong>
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript"
        ><strong>going through a JavaScript tutorial</strong></a
      >
      <strong>to check your knowledge level</strong> and enable you to follow
      along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30
      minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re
      learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.
