      >(https://twitter.com/gumnos) for pointing out that I can use zero-width
      space would be a cleaner solution. I have updated the code below to
      reflect this.

    <hr />
    <p>
      A bug that keeps hitting me at work is VoiceOver not announcing unordered
      lists properly when either the <code>list-style-type</code> is set to
      <code>none</code> or <code>display</code> is set to <code>inline</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expected behavior is that the unordered list is announced with a role
      of list along with the number of items, for example “list 4 items.”
      Lastly, “end of list” is announced after the last item to again let a user
      know that there are no more items in the list. For whatever reason,
      setting the <code>list-style-type</code> to <code>none</code> or setting
      <code>display</code> to <code>inline</code> on the
      &lt;<code>li</code>&gt;’s will strip this useful information.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is problematic, for me, because unordered lists are usually used for
      navigational items, like top-level navigation or side navigation. With
      most top-level nav, <code>display: inline;</code> is used for presenting a
      horizontal list of items, while <code>list-style-type: none;</code> is
      used to remove the bullets that render by default so you can have stylized
      list of links. You do this a lot, you know you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is kind of a big deal to so I wanted to see if I could figure out a
      way to get it working right.
    </p>
    <h2 id="aria-to-the-rescue">ARIA to the rescue?</h2>
    <p>
      An obvious solution is to use ARIA roles <code>list</code> and
      <code>listitem</code> to restore the semantics.
    </p>
    <p>Returning list semantics with ARIA</p>
    <p>
      This definitely works, but I don’t like it. It requires too much markup. I
      also feel that since CSS caused the issue, I should be able to solve it
      with CSS.
    </p>
    <h2 id="css-the-real-hero">CSS, the real hero</h2>
    <p>
      It didn’t take long before I came up with the following solution. I
      haven’t spent any time trying to figure out why it works yet, which means
      that I also don’t understand what other consequences there are.
    </p>
    <p>
      For whatever reason, adding some pseudo content before each item will
      magically return list semantics in VoiceOver.
    </p>
    <p>Returning list semantics with CSS</p>
    <p>
      With that bit of additional CSS, we are able to return the list semantics
      for VoiceOver users without needing to touch the markup.
    </p>
    <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
    <p>
      One of the best things about this simple fix is that it does not impact
      JAWS or NVDA, at least with the versions I have tested:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Safari 10.1.2 and VoiceOver/ macOS 10.11.6</li>
      <li>Safari 10.1.2 and VoiceOver/ macOS 10.12.6</li>
      <li>Safari 11.0 and VoiceOver/ macOS 10.12.6</li>
      <li>
        Safari Technology Preview Release 40 (11.1) and VoiceOver/ macOS 10.12.6
      </li>
      <li>Firefox 52.3.0 and NVDA 2015.4 (Thanks Shell!)</li>
      <li>IE 11 and JAWS 18.0.2324 (Thanks Richard!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="item-position">Item Position?</h2>
    <p>
      I was surprised that the JAWS and NVDA was not announcing the position of
      each item in the list by default, e.g. 1 of 4, 2 of 4, etc. The two
      testers I talked to said they are not used to hearing that information.
      VoiceOver 10.11.6 didn’t announce either, but 10.12.6 did. I am sure there
      is some verbosity settings at play here. If you really need, you could
      always use <code>aria-setsize</code> and/ or <code>aria-posinset</code>.
      In any case, I was satisfied knowing that the fixed list announced the
      same as the default list.
    </p>
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Adding some pseudo-content before the list item will add the list
      semantics back to the list, in the most simple case it could be some
      zero-width space. It could be any pseudo-content, but it definitely needs
      to be before, not after. Just make sure whatever you add does not get in
      the way of interacting with the list item.
