      Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of pseudocode with
      respect to the input size n of each of the following:
    </p>
    <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
      <pre
        class="sourceCode python"
      ><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">a)  a <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">    <span class="cf">while</span> (a <span class="op">&lt;</span> n <span class="op">*</span> n <span class="op">*</span> n):</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">      a <span class="op">=</span> a <span class="op">+</span> n <span class="op">*</span> n</a></code></pre>
    </div>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        O(n) because n is the difference between the powers n^2 (worth of each
        step) and n^3 (max)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      j = 1
      while j &lt; n:
        j *= 2
        sum += 1</code></pre>
    <ol start="2" type="a">
      <li>O(n^2) because there are two nested loops</li>
    </ol>
    <pre><code>c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)</code></pre>
    <ol start="3" type="a">
      <li>O(n log n) because it is recursive</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also
      that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn’t
      get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to
      determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is
      minimized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give
      the runtime complexity of your solution.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>loop through 0 to n-1 to represent each story</li>
      <li>
        you will not actually loop through every story, only up to where the
        eggs start breaking
      </li>
      <li>try to drop an egg off of each floor</li>
      <li>if it is successful (no breakage), go to next floor</li>
      <li>if egg breaks, save current story as variable and exit loop</li>
      <li>subtract 1 from current story</li>
      <li>return story</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The runtime of this would be O(n) because there is one loop and it is
          dependent on the number of building stories.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you could do a binary search, start at n/2 and then do
        upper or lower half depending on if it breaks or not until you get the
        max floor.
      </li>
      <li><p>This would be runtime O(log n).</p></li>
    </ul>
