      Object Oriented Design Questions
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Object Oriented Design questions, interviewers are looking for your
      understanding of the nuances of complex problems and your ability to
      transform the requirements into comprehensible Classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, OOD questions generally will all follow a very similar pattern.
      You will be provided with a vague problem and a set of constraints for a
      system to design, and very little else. It is then up to you, the
      candidate, to figure out the “level” of solution that the interviewer is
      looking for, what kind of functionality will be needed, and come up with a
      workable solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interviewers are looking for one main thing: finding the right balance
      between a solution that works immediately and is also adaptable to change
      in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify things, you can take the following approach for any OOD
      question you encounter:
    </p>
    <h2 id="clarify-the-requirements">Clarify the requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Make sure you understand the expectations of the interviewer. Ask
      clarifying questions if at all necessary — the interviewer will not mind,
      and will likely appreciate it. For example, “are you looking for me to
      demonstrate the structure of a solution, or to fully implement it?” Doing
      this here will take about 5–10 seconds, but save tremendous amounts of
      time later.
    </p>
    <h2 id="hash-out-the-primary-use-cases">Hash out the primary use cases</h2>
    <p>
      Think about, and then talk through, use cases. Make sure you understand
      all the different functionality your system is expected to have. Talking
      about it out loud can also help you to come across expectations or ideas
      you might not have realized if you just jumped right in.
    </p>
    <h2 id="identify-key-objects">Identify key Objects</h2>
    <p>
      Now, identify all the objects that will play a role in your solution. For
      example, if you’re designing a parking lot, these will be things like
      vehicles, parking spots, parking garages, entrances, exits, garage
      operators, etc.
    </p>
    <h2 id="identify-operations-supported-by-objects">
      Identify Operations supported by Objects
    </h2>
    <p>
      Work out all the behaviors you’d expect each object that you identified in
      the previous step to have. For example, a car should be able to move, park
      in a given spot, and hold a license plate. A parking spot should be able
      to accommodate a two-wheeled vehicle or a four-wheeled vehicle — and so
      on.
    </p>
    <h2 id="identify-interactions-between-objects">
      Identify Interactions between Objects
    </h2>
    <p>
      Map out the relationships between the different objects that will need to
      interface with each other. This is where it all comes together. For
      example, a car should be able to park in a parking spot. Parking garages
      should be able to fit multiple parking spots, and so on.
