      Tips For Solving A Larger Problem
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>identify smaller components that make up larger problem</li>
      <li>
        digest and comprehend problem by rewriting in your own words how you
        would describe it to someone else
      </li>
      <li>diagram how data flows through problem</li>
      <li>
        think about each stage of journey of data and what will happen as it

      What Are Some Tips On Successfully Planning
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Solve problem like human</li>
      <li>break steps into small enough pieces for computer to understand</li>
      <li>approach problem from many angles</li>
      <li>get brute-force solution ASAP even if it’s not performant enough</li>
      <li>come up with as many attack plans as you can</li>
      <li>try to solve a simpler version of the problem</li>
      <li>if input is a 2D array, can you solve it for a 1D array?</li>
      <li>solution to simpler may lead to insights on more complex problem</li>
      <li>
        list nouns and verbs in problem description
        <ul>
          <li>
            map each one to algorithm, process, data structure, object, method,
            etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="execute">Execute</h3>
    <p>
      Take your plan and convert it to actual working code. The better you do
      with steps 1 and 2, the easier this is. Drop back steps as necessary.
