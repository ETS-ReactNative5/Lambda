        <p>
          Do I understand the basic algorithms and data structures well enough
          to be able to explain it to someone else? See https://lnkd.in/dx_m4Sa
          for a list of most common ones.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Can I code these data structures and algorithms quickly and completely
          from memory? e.g.Â Can I write quicksort or merge sort right now? Can I
          implement DFS both iteratively and recursively right now? Just
          practice writing it repeatedly saves it in our muscle memory.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Can I easily calculate the running time complexity of an algorithm?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Can I solve a DS&amp;A problem in 30-40 minutes by taking 10-15
          minutes maximum in coming up with a solution, 15-20 minutes in coding
          it, and remaining time in testing it?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Can I dry-run code to prove that it is correct?</p></li>
