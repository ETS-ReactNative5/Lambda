The idea is that one will be able to quickly recall meaning of the material the more that one repeats it. This technique is widely used in the mastery of foundational knowledge. Examples are utilizing flashcards to study information, mnemonic devices and creating outline notes. This can also include reading over notes or a textbook several times. A common rote learning technique used in college is rewriting lecture notes.</p><p id="2d3fdb5c-f425-4e71-8e0a-29d5d7904c7d" class="">There are many concepts in programming, design and data science that are just going to take a lot of &quot;reps&quot;.

Work on your problem for 20 minutes by clearly defining it, figuring out the desired outcome and brainstorming solutions. If the Student&#x27;s problem is not solved in these steps then it is time to reach out for assistance. Instead of a generic &quot;I can&#x27;t do this, I don&#x27;t even know where to start&quot; Learners should have a &quot;In the last section of this piece of code I don&#x27;t understand this particular part and would like assistance finding this particular resource&quot;. This makes the Student&#x27;s question easier to answer for instructors, team leads and staff. It also shows that they took the time to try to think critically and problem solve before asking.

Independent learners know how to evaluate themselves. They can see their strengths and weaknesses and are willing to work on improving both. They strive for measurable progress and appreciate critical feedback so that they can improve.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="8af7e702-9da1-4303-9fbc-d0cdb27073ad" class="numbered-list" start="4"><li><em><strong>Responsibility</strong></em>- Responsibility means knowing what Learners have to do and doing it without anyone telling them to. It is being sure they meet objectives and meet due dates. An independent learner becomes less dependent on outside sources for discipline or motivation.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="df06f2a4-6603-4d0a-8b9f-b51056018de0" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li><em><strong>Critical Thinking</strong></em>- Independent learners think critically about a situation. They examine all possibilities and often come up with many solutions. They don’t memorize. Rather they ask “why?” and formulate answers based on real-world observation and intelligent deduction.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="4c670c42-a49b-4539-9c3c-6160a7dd76bf" class="numbered-list" start="6"><li><em><strong>Perseverance</strong></em>- Independent learners don’t give up. They strive to understand a concept as much as possible on their own before asking for help. They also apply self-discipline in not finding the easy answer to a problem. They teach themselves and generally only ask questions after failure to find a solution on their own. An independent learner understands that seeking support is a strength not a weakness, so when they hit a block they do reach out.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="a0fa775f-3f4c-4bd5-a9be-f094b4bc679e" class="numbered-list" start="7"><li><em><strong>Positive Attitude</strong></em>- When things get tough and frustration sets in an independent learner maintains a positive attitude. They have the outlook that they will eventually figure out the solution to any problem. It just might take more time and there is no need to get upset.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="8eafd158-3a1a-4429-839f-d186f3b84d2e" class="numbered-list" start="8"><li><em><strong>Learning from Failure</strong></em>- One of the major obstacles preventing learners from becoming more independent is a fear of failure.
