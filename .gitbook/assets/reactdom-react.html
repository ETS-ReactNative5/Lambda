      If you load React from a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, these top-level
      APIs are available on the <code>ReactDOM</code> global. If you use ES6
      with npm, you can write <code>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'</code>. If
      you use ES5 with npm, you can write
      <code>var ReactDOM = require('react-dom')</code>.

    <p>
      The <code>react-dom</code> package provides DOM-specific methods that can
      be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside
      of the React model if you need to. Most of your components should not need
      to use this module.

      React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and
      above, although
      <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/javascript-environment-requirements.html"
        >some polyfills are required</a
      >
      for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note</p>
      <p>
        We don’t support older browsers that don’t support ES5 methods, but you
        may find that your apps do work in older browsers if polyfills such as
        <a href="https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim">es5-shim and es5-sham</a>
        are included in the page. You’re on your own if you choose to take this

    </h3>
    <pre><code>ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])</code></pre>
    <p>
      Render a React element into the DOM in the supplied
      <code>container</code> and return a
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/more-about-refs.html">reference</a> to
      the component (or returns <code>null</code> for
      <a
        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components"
        >stateless components</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the React element was previously rendered into <code>container</code>,
      this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to
      reflect the latest React element.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the
      component is rendered or updated.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note:</p>
      <p>
        <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> controls the contents of the container
        node you pass in. Any existing DOM elements inside are replaced when
        first called. Later calls use React’s DOM diffing algorithm for
        efficient updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> does not modify the container node (only
        modifies the children of the container). It may be possible to insert a
        component to an existing DOM node without overwriting the existing
        children.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> currently returns a reference to the root
        <code>ReactComponent</code> instance. However, using this return value
        is legacy and should be avoided because future versions of React may
        render components asynchronously in some cases. If you need a reference
        to the root <code>ReactComponent</code> instance, the preferred solution
        is to attach a
        <a
          href="https://reactjs.org/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute"
          >callback ref</a
        >
        to the root element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> to hydrate a server-rendered
        container is deprecated and will be removed in React 17. Use
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate"
          ><code>hydrate()</code></a
        >
        instead.

      ><code>hydrate()</code>

    <pre><code>ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container[, callback])</code></pre>
    <p>
      Same as
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#render"
        ><code>render()</code></a
      >, but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by
      <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html"
        ><code>ReactDOMServer</code></a
      >. React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server
      and the client. It can patch up differences in text content, but you
      should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React
      warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that
      attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is
      important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are
      rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different
      between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may
      silence the warning by adding
      <code>suppressHydrationWarning={true}</code> to the element. It only works
      one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it.
      Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it
      may remain inconsistent until future updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and
      the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render
      something different on the client can read a state variable like
      <code>this.state.isClient</code>, which you can set to
      <code>true</code> in <code>componentDidMount()</code>. This way the
      initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding
      mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after
      hydration. Note that this approach will make your components slower
      because they have to render twice, so use it with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember to be mindful of user experience on slow connections. The
      JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render,
      so if you render something different in the client-only pass, the
      transition can be jarring. However, if executed well, it may be beneficial
      to render a “shell” of the application on the server, and only show some
      of the extra widgets on the client. To learn how to do this without
      getting the markup mismatch issues, refer to the explanation in the
      previous paragraph.

      Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event
      handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling
      this function does nothing. Returns <code>true</code> if a component was
      unmounted and <code>false</code> if there was no component to unmount.

      <p>Note:</p>
      <p>
        <code>findDOMNode</code> is an escape hatch used to access the
        underlying DOM node. In most cases, use of this escape hatch is
        discouraged because it pierces the component abstraction.

    <pre><code>ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component)</code></pre>
    <p>
      If this component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the
      corresponding native browser DOM element. This method is useful for
      reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values and performing
      DOM measurements.
      <strong
        >In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using
        <code>findDOMNode</code> at all.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When a component renders to <code>null</code> or <code>false</code>,
      <code>findDOMNode</code> returns <code>null</code>. When a component
      renders to a string, <code>findDOMNode</code> returns a text DOM node
      containing that value. As of React 16, a component may return a fragment
      with multiple children, in which case <code>findDOMNode</code> will return
      the DOM node corresponding to the first non-empty child.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note:</p>
      <p>
        <code>findDOMNode</code> only works on mounted components (that is,
        components that have been placed in the DOM). If you try to call this on
        a component that has not been mounted yet (like calling
        <code>findDOMNode()</code> in <code>render()</code> on a component that
        has yet to be created) an exception will be thrown.
      </p>
      <p><code>findDOMNode</code> cannot be used on function components.</p>
