# React Notes



This appendix is a non-exhaustive list of new syntactic features and methods that were added to JavaScript in ES6. These features are the most commonly used and most helpful.

While this appendix doesn't cover ES6 classes, we go over the basics while learning about components in the book. In addition, this appendix doesn't include descriptions of some larger new features like promises and generators. If you'd like more info on those or on any topic below, we encourage you to reference the [Mozilla Developer Network's website](https://developer.mozilla.org/) \(MDN\).

## Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`

If you've worked with ES5 JavaScript before, you're likely used to seeing variables declared with `var`:

```text
ar myVariable = 5;
```

Both the `const` and `let` statements also declare variables. They were introduced in ES6.

Use `const` in cases where a variable is never re-assigned. Using `const` makes this clear to whoever is reading your code. It refers to the "constant" state of the variable in the context it is defined within.

If the variable will be re-assigned, use `let`.

We encourage the use of `const` and `let` instead of `var`. In addition to the restriction introduced by `const`, both `const` and `let` are _block scoped_ as opposed to _function scoped_. This scoping can help avoid unexpected bugs.

## Arrow functions

There are three ways to write arrow function bodies. For the examples below, let's say we have an array of city objects:

```text
onst cities = [
  { name: 'Cairo', pop: 7764700 },
  { name: 'Lagos', pop: 8029200 },
];
```

If we write an arrow function that spans multiple lines, we must use braces to delimit the function body like this:

```text
const formattedPopulations = cities.map((city) => {
  const popMM = (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2);
  return popMM + ' million';
});
console.log(formattedPopulations);
```

Note that we must also explicitly specify a `return` for the function.

However, if we write a function body that is only a single line \(or single expression\) we can use parentheses to delimit it:

```text
const formattedPopulations2 = cities.map((city) => (
  (city.pop / 1000000).toFixed(2) + ' million'
));
```

Notably, we don't use `return` as it's implied.

Furthermore, if your function body is terse you can write it like so:

```text
const pops = cities.map(city => city.pop);
console.log(pops);
```

The terseness of arrow functions is one of two reasons that we use them. Compare the one-liner above to this:

```text
const popsNoArrow = cities.map(function(city) { return city.pop });
```

Of greater benefit, though, is how arrow functions bind the `this` object.

The traditional JavaScript function declaration syntax \(`function () {}`\) will bind `this` in anonymous functions to the global object. To illustrate the confusion this causes, consider the following example:

```text
unction printSong() {
  console.log("Oops - The Global Object");
}

const jukebox = {
  songs: [
    {
      title: "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'",
      artist: "Michael Jackson",
    },
    {
      title: "Superstar",
      artist: "Madonna",
    },
  ],
  printSong: function (song) {
    console.log(song.title + " - " + song.artist);
  },
  printSongs: function () {

    this.songs.forEach(function(song) {

      this.printSong(song);
    });
  },
}

jukebox.printSongs();
```

The method `printSongs()` iterates over `this.songs` with `forEach()`. In this context, `this` is bound to the object \(`jukebox`\) as expected. However, the anonymous function passed to `forEach()` binds its internal `this` to the global object. As such, `this.printSong(song)` calls the function declared at the top of the example, _not_ the method on `jukebox`.

JavaScript developers have traditionally used workarounds for this behavior, but arrow functions solve the problem by **capturing the `this` value of the enclosing context**. Using an arrow function for `printSongs()` has the expected result:

```text
  printSongs: function () {
    this.songs.forEach((song) => {

      this.printSong(song);
    });
  },
}

jukebox.printSongs();
```

For this reason, throughout the book we use arrow functions for all anonymous functions.

## Modules

ES6 formally supports modules using the `import`/`export` syntax.

**Named exports**

Inside any file, you can use `export` to specify a variable the module should expose. Here's an example of a file that exports two functions:

```text
export const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
export const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));
```

Now, anywhere we wanted to use these functions we could use `import`. We need to specify which functions we want to import. A common way of doing this is using ES6's destructuring assignment syntax to list them out like this:

```text
import { sayHi, sayBye } from './greetings';

sayHi(); 
sayBye();
```

Importantly, the function that was _not_ exported \(`saySomething`\) is unavailable outside of the module.

Also note that we supply a **relative path** to `from`, indicating that the ES6 module is a local file as opposed to an npm package.

Instead of inserting an `export` before each variable you'd like to export, you can use this syntax to list off all the exposed variables in one area:

```text
const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));

export { sayHi, sayBye };
```

We can also specify that we'd like to import all of a module's functionality underneath a given namespace with the `import * as <Namespace>` syntax:

```text
import * as Greetings from './greetings';

Greetings.sayHi();

Greetings.sayBye();

Greetings.saySomething();
```

**Default export**

The other type of export is a default export. A module can only contain one default export:

```text
const sayHi = () => (console.log('Hi!'));
const sayBye = () => (console.log('Bye!'));

const saySomething = () => (console.log('Something!'));

const Greetings = { sayHi, sayBye };

export default Greetings;
```

This is a common pattern for libraries. It means you can easily import the library wholesale without specifying what individual functions you want:

```text
import Greetings from './greetings';

Greetings.sayHi(); 
Greetings.sayBye();
```

It's not uncommon for a module to use a mix of both named exports and default exports. For instance, with `react-dom`, you can import `ReactDOM` \(a default export\) like this:

```text
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(

);
```

Or, if you're only going to use the `render()` function, you can import the named `render()` function like this:

```text
import { render } from 'react-dom';

render(

);
```

To achieve this flexibility, the export implementation for `react-dom` looks something like this:

```text
export const render = (component, target) => {

};

const ReactDOM = {
  render,

};

export default ReactDOM;
```

If you want to play around with the module syntax, check out the folder `code/webpack/es6-modules`.

For more reading on ES6 modules, see this article from Mozilla: "[ES6 in Depth: Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/)".

## `Object.assign()`

We use `Object.assign()` often throughout the book. We use it in areas where we want to create a modified version of an existing object.

`Object.assign()` accepts any number of objects as arguments. When the function receives two arguments, it _copies_ the properties of the second object onto the first, like so:

```text
onst coffee = { };
const noCream = { cream: false };
const noMilk = { milk: false };
Object.assign(coffee, noCream);
```

It is idiomatic to pass in three arguments to `Object.assign()`. The first argument is a new JavaScript object, the one that `Object.assign()` will ultimately return. The second is the object whose properties we'd like to build off of. The last is the changes we'd like to apply:

```text
const coffeeWithMilk = Object.assign({}, coffee, { milk: true });
```

`Object.assign()` is a handy method for working with "immutable" JavaScript objects.

## Template literals

In ES5 JavaScript, you'd interpolate variables into strings like this:

```text
var greeting = 'Hello, ' + user + '! It is ' + degF + ' degrees outside.';
```

With ES6 template literals, we can create the same string like this:

```text
const greeting = `Hello, ${user}! It is ${degF} degrees outside.`;
```

## The spread operator \(`...`\)

In arrays, the ellipsis `...` operator will _expand_ the array that follows into the parent array. The spread operator enables us to succinctly construct new arrays as a composite of existing arrays.

Here is an example:

```text
onst a = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
const b = [ 4, 5, 6 ];
const c = [ ...a, ...b, 7, 8, 9 ];

console.log(c);
```

Notice how this is different than if we wrote:

```text
const d = [ a, b, 7, 8, 9 ];
console.log(d);
```

## Enhanced object literals

In ES5, all objects were required to have explicit key and value declarations:

```text
const explicit = {
  getState: getState,
  dispatch: dispatch,
};
```

In ES6, you can use this terser syntax whenever the property name and variable name are the same:

```text
const implicit = {
  getState,
  dispatch,
};
```

Lots of open source libraries use this syntax, so it's good to be familiar with it. But whether you use it in your own code is a matter of stylistic preference.

## Default arguments

With ES6, you can specify a default value for an argument in the case that it is `undefined` when the function is called.

This:

```text
unction divide(a, b) {

  const divisor = typeof b === 'undefined' ? 1 : b;

  return a / divisor;
}
```

Can be written as this:

```text
function divide(a, b = 1) {
  return a / b;
}
```

In both cases, using the function looks like this:

```text
divide(14, 2);

divide(14, undefined);

divide(14);
```

Whenever the argument `b` in the example above is `undefined`, the default argument is used. Note that `null` will not use the default argument:

```text
divide(14, null);
```

## Destructuring assignments

### For arrays

In ES5, extracting and assigning multiple elements from an array looked like this:

```text
ar fruits = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'oranges' ];
var fruit1 = fruits[0];
var fruit2 = fruits[1];
```

In ES6, we can use the destructuring syntax to accomplish the same task like this:

```text
const [ veg1, veg2 ] = [ 'asparagus', 'broccoli', 'onion' ];
console.log(veg1); 
console.log(veg2);
```

The variables in the array on the left are "matched" and assigned to the corresponding elements in the array on the right. Note that `'onion'` is ignored and has no variable bound to it.

### For objects

We can do something similar for extracting object properties into variables:

```text
const smoothie = {
  fats: [ 'avocado', 'peanut butter', 'greek yogurt' ],
  liquids: [ 'almond milk' ],
  greens: [ 'spinach' ],
  fruits: [ 'blueberry', 'banana' ],
};

const { liquids, fruits } = smoothie;

console.log(liquids); 
console.log(fruits);
```

### Parameter context matching

We can use these same principles to bind arguments inside a function to properties of an object supplied as an argument:

```text
const containsSpinach = ({ greens }) => {
  if (greens.find(g => g === 'spinach')) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

containsSpinach(smoothie);
```

We do this often with functional React components:

```text
const IngredientList = ({ ingredients, onClick }) => (
  <ul className='IngredientList'>
    {
      ingredients.map(i => (
        <li
          key={i.id}
          onClick={() => onClick(i.id)}
          className='item'
        >
          {i.name}
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
)
```

Here, we use destructuring to extract the props into variables \(`ingredients` and `onClick`\) that we then use inside the component's function body.

# Components And Props

## Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a [detailed component API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs \(called “props”\) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components <a id="function-and-class-components"></a>

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```text
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” \(which stands for properties\) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) to define a component:

```text
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

Function and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss in the [next sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

### Rendering a Component <a id="rendering-a-component"></a>

Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:

```text
const element = <div />;
```

However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```text
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```text
function Welcome(props) {  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/rendering-a-component)

Let’s recap what happens in this example:

1. We call `ReactDOM.render()` with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element.
2. React calls the `Welcome` component with `{name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
3. Our `Welcome` component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>` element as the result.
4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`.

> **Note:** Always start component names with a capital letter.
>
> React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, `<div />` represents an HTML div tag, but `<Welcome />` represents a component and requires `Welcome` to be in scope.
>
> To learn more about the reasoning behind this convention, please read [JSX In Depth](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#user-defined-components-must-be-capitalized).

### Composing Components <a id="composing-components"></a>

Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

For example, we can create an `App` component that renders `Welcome` many times:

```text
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />      <Welcome name="Cahal" />      <Welcome name="Edite" />    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/composing-components)

Typically, new React apps have a single `App` component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like `Button` and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

### Extracting Components <a id="extracting-components"></a>

Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.

For example, consider this `Comment` component:

```text
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/components-and-props/extracting-components)

It accepts `author` \(an object\), `text` \(a string\), and `date` \(a date\) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.

This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it.

First, we will extract `Avatar`:

```text
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"      src={props.user.avatarUrl}      alt={props.user.name}    />  );
}
```

The `Avatar` doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a `Comment`. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: `user` rather than `author`.

We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.

We can now simplify `Comment` a tiny bit:

```text
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.author} />        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next, we will extract a `UserInfo` component that renders an `Avatar` next to the user’s name:

```text
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">      <Avatar user={props.user} />      <div className="UserInfo-name">        {props.user.name}      </div>    </div>  );
}
```

This lets us simplify `Comment` even further:

```text
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times \(`Button`, `Panel`, `Avatar`\), or is complex enough on its own \(`App`, `FeedStory`, `Comment`\), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.

### Props are Read-Only <a id="props-are-read-only"></a>

Whether you declare a component [as a function or a class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), it must never modify its own props. Consider this `sum` function:

```text
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Such functions are called [“pure”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```text
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), we will introduce a new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

# Composition vs Inheritance

React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition.

### Containment

Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like `Sidebar` or `Dialog` that represent generic “boxes”.

We recommend that such components use the special `children` prop to pass children elements directly into their output:

```text
function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}    </div>
  );
}
```

This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX:

```text
function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">        Welcome      </h1>      <p className="Dialog-message">        Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!      </p>    </FancyBorder>
  );
}
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ozqNOV?editors=0010)

Anything inside the `<FancyBorder>` JSX tag gets passed into the `FancyBorder` component as a `children` prop. Since `FancyBorder` renders `{props.children}` inside a `<div>`, the passed elements appear in the final output.

While this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple “holes” in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using `children`:

```text
function SplitPane(props) {
  return (
    <div className="SplitPane">
      <div className="SplitPane-left">
        {props.left}      </div>
      <div className="SplitPane-right">
        {props.right}      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <SplitPane
      left={
        <Contacts />      }
      right={
        <Chat />      } />
  );
}
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwZOJp?editors=0010)

React elements like `<Contacts />` and `<Chat />` are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of “slots” in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React.

### Specialization

Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components. For example, we might say that a `WelcomeDialog` is a special case of `Dialog`.

In React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more “specific” component renders a more “generic” one and configures it with props:

```text
function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">
        {props.title}      </h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">
        {props.message}      </p>
    </FancyBorder>
  );
}

function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog      title="Welcome"      message="Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!" />  );
}
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/kkEaOZ?editors=0010)

Composition works equally well for components defined as classes:

```text
function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">
        {props.title}
      </h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">
        {props.message}
      </p>
      {props.children}    </FancyBorder>
  );
}

class SignUpDialog extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSignUp = this.handleSignUp.bind(this);
    this.state = {login: ''};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Dialog title="Mars Exploration Program"
              message="How should we refer to you?">
        <input value={this.state.login}               onChange={this.handleChange} />        <button onClick={this.handleSignUp}>          Sign Me Up!        </button>      </Dialog>
    );
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({login: e.target.value});
  }

  handleSignUp() {
    alert(`Welcome aboard, ${this.state.login}!`);
  }
}
```

### So What About Inheritance?

At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.

If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.

## Hello World

The smallest React example looks like this:

```text
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.

### How to Read This Guide <a id="how-to-read-this-guide"></a>

In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

> Tip
>
> This guide is designed for people who prefer **learning concepts step by step**. If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). You might find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.

This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. **You can learn most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar.** For example, [“Introducing JSX”](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is the next chapter after this one.

### Knowledge Level Assumptions <a id="knowledge-level-assumptions"></a>

React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. **If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend** [**going through a JavaScript tutorial**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) **to check your knowledge level** and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.

> Note
>
> This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven’t worked with JavaScript in the last few years, [these three points](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/683e676101005de0add59e8bb345340c) should get you most of the way.

# JSX



## Introducing JSX

Consider this variable declaration:

```text
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html). Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

#### Why JSX? <a id="why-jsx"></a>

React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

Instead of artificially separating _technologies_ by putting markup and logic in separate files, React [separates _concerns_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a [further section](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html), but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7cQ3mrcKaY) might convince you otherwise.

React [doesn’t require](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

With that out of the way, let’s get started!

#### Embedding Expressions in JSX <a id="embedding-expressions-in-jsx"></a>

In the example below, we declare a variable called `name` and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

```text
const name = 'Josh Perez';const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You can put any valid [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Expressions) inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, `2 + 2`, `user.firstName`, or `formatName(user)` are all valid JavaScript expressions.

In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, `formatName(user)`, into an `<h1>` element.

```text
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

[**Try it on CodePen**](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx)

We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of [automatic semicolon insertion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2846283).

#### JSX is an Expression Too <a id="jsx-is-an-expression-too"></a>

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```text
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;}
```

#### Specifying Attributes with JSX <a id="specifying-attributes-with-jsx"></a>

You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```text
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```text
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes \(for string values\) or curly braces \(for expressions\), but not both in the same attribute.

> **Warning:**
>
> Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses `camelCase` property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.
>
> For example, `class` becomes [`className`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className) in JSX, and `tabindex` becomes [`tabIndex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/tabIndex).

#### Specifying Children with JSX <a id="specifying-children-with-jsx"></a>

If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`, like XML:

```text
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

JSX tags may contain children:

```text
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

#### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks <a id="jsx-prevents-injection-attacks"></a>

It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

```text
const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

By default, React DOM [escapes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7381974/which-characters-need-to-be-escaped-on-html) any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent [XSS \(cross-site-scripting\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.

#### JSX Represents Objects <a id="jsx-represents-objects"></a>

Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```text
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```text
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```text
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the [next section](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html).

> **Tip:**
>
> We recommend using the [“Babel” language definition](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/editors) for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.

# REACT ENVIORMENT

First thing we need to do is setup our development environment and hook up React. Our end goal will be to get a basic message up on screen. Let's create a new directory and download the packages we need.

```text
mkdir starwars_api
cd starwars_api
npm init -y
npm install --save react react-dom redux react-redux redux-thunk
npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react webpack@2.1.0-beta.27 file-loader babel-loader webpack-dev-server@2.1.0-beta.11 react-hot-loader@3.0.0-beta.6
```

Now let's create our entrance file. Create a file at `src/app.js` and put the following in it.

```text
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';
import { AppContainer } from 'react-hot-loader';

require('./index.html');

// Create app
const container = document.querySelector('#app-container');

// Render app
ReactDOM.render(
  <AppContainer>
    <App />
  </AppContainer>
  , container
);

// Hot module reloading
if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept('./components/App', () => {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <AppContainer>
        <App />
      </AppContainer>
      , container
    );
  });
}
```

We are displaying a central `App` component. So let's create it! Create a file at `src/components/App.js` and put the following in it.

```text
import React from 'react';

const App = () =>
  <div className='container'>
    <div className='row'>
      Hello, World!
    </div>
  </div>;

export default App;
```

We also need to create our `index.html` file that we are including in our `app.js` file. Create a file at `src/index.html` and put the following in it.

```text
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>React Star Wars</title>

  <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">

  <!-- Optional theme -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-rHyoN1iRsVXV4nD0JutlnGaslCJuC7uwjduW9SVrLvRYooPp2bWYgmgJQIXwl/Sp" crossorigin="anonymous">

  <style>
    h1 {
      font-size: 30px;
      font-weight: 200;
    }

    h2 {
      font-size: 22px;
      margin-top: 5px;
    }

    ul {
      padding-left: 15px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app-container"></div>
  <script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This is a basic HTML page. We are including Bootstrap and its basic theme for some simple styles. We also are adding some styles in a `style` tag to help with the sizing of some elements. In the `body`, we are adding our container element and our main app bundle.

Now that we have all that setup, let's create a webpack config that we can use to build our project. Create a file in the root of your project called `webpack.config.js` and put the following in it.

```text
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    'react-hot-loader/patch',
    './src/app.js',
  ],
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './build'),
    filename: 'app.bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.html$/,
        loader: 'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]',
      },
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin(),
  ],
};
```

Here we are exporting our config object like normal. We point webpack to start at our `app.js` file and tell everything to output to a `build` directory. We run all HTML files though the file loader. This essentially just moves the file to our `build` directory. Also, we run our JS files through the babel loader to make sure they are transpiled to code that most browsers these days understand. Lastly, we are including a plugin that will give us pretty output in the console.

Let's create a `.babelrc` file to configure babel.

```text
{
  "presets": [
    ["es2015", { "modules": false }],
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "react-hot-loader/babel"
  ]
}
```

Last thing. Let's create some npm scripts so that we don't need to remember the commands we need to run our application. Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file in the `scripts` section.

# Thinking in React



## Start With A Mock

Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:

![Mockup](https://reactjs.org/static/1071fbcc9eed01fddc115b41e193ec11/d4770/thinking-in-react-mock.png)

Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this:

```text
[
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
];
```

## Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component \(and subcomponent\) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!

But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI \(and therefore your component structure\) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same _information architecture_. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.

![Component diagram](https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png)

You’ll see here that we have five components in our app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents.

1. **`FilterableProductTable` \(orange\):** contains the entirety of the example
2. **`SearchBar` \(blue\):** receives all _user input_
3. **`ProductTable` \(green\):** displays and filters the _data collection_ based on _user input_
4. **`ProductCategoryRow` \(turquoise\):** displays a heading for each _category_
5. **`ProductRow` \(red\):** displays a row for each _product_

If you look at `ProductTable`, you’ll see that the table header \(containing the “Name” and “Price” labels\) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of `ProductTable` because it is part of rendering the _data collection_ which is `ProductTable`’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex \(e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting\), it would certainly make sense to make this its own `ProductTableHeader` component.

Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

* `FilterableProductTable`
  * `SearchBar`
  * `ProductTable`
    * `ProductCategoryRow`
    * `ProductRow`

## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.

To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using _props_. _props_ are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of _state_, **don’t use state at all** to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy \(i.e. starting with `FilterableProductTable`\) or with the ones lower in it \(`ProductRow`\). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have `render()` methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy \(`FilterableProductTable`\) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call `ReactDOM.render()` again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s **one-way data flow** \(also called _one-way binding_\) keeps everything modular and fast.

Refer to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/) if you need help executing this step.

### A Brief Interlude: Props vs State

There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state. It’s important to understand the distinction between the two; skim [the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) if you aren’t sure what the difference is. See also [FAQ: What is the difference between state and props?](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props)

## Step 3: Identify The Minimal \(but complete\) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with **state**.

To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is [DRY: _Don’t Repeat Yourself_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.

Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:

* The original list of products
* The search text the user has entered
* The value of the checkbox
* The filtered list of products

Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.

So finally, our state is:

* The search text the user has entered
* The value of the checkbox

## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

OK, so we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or _owns_, this state.

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. **This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand,** so follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
* Find a common owner component \(a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy\).
* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
* If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

* `ProductTable` needs to filter the product list based on state and `SearchBar` needs to display the search text and checked state.
* The common owner component is `FilterableProductTable`.
* It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in `FilterableProductTable`

Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in `FilterableProductTable`. First, add an instance property `this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false}` to `FilterableProductTable`’s `constructor` to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass `filterText` and `inStockOnly` to `ProductTable` and `SearchBar` as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in `ProductTable` and set the values of the form fields in `SearchBar`.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set `filterText` to `"ball"` and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly.

## Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in `FilterableProductTable`.

React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.

If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the `value` prop of the `input` to always be equal to the `state` passed in from `FilterableProductTable`.

Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, `FilterableProductTable` will pass callbacks to `SearchBar` that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the `onChange` event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by `FilterableProductTable` will call `setState()`, and the app will be updated.

## And That’s It

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you’re used to, remember that code is read far more than it’s written, and it’s less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you’ll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :\)

# Glossary

## Single-page Application

A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets \(such as JavaScript and CSS\) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded.

Though you may build a single-page application in React, it is not a requirement. React can also be used for enhancing small parts of existing websites with additional interactivity. Code written in React can coexist peacefully with markup rendered on the server by something like PHP, or with other client-side libraries. In fact, this is exactly how React is being used at Facebook.

## ES6, ES2015, ES2016, etc

These acronyms all refer to the most recent versions of the ECMAScript Language Specification standard, which the JavaScript language is an implementation of. The ES6 version \(also known as ES2015\) includes many additions to the previous versions such as: arrow functions, classes, template literals, `let` and `const` statements. You can learn more about specific versions [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions).

## Compilers

A JavaScript compiler takes JavaScript code, transforms it and returns JavaScript code in a different format. The most common use case is to take ES6 syntax and transform it into syntax that older browsers are capable of interpreting. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the compiler most commonly used with React.

## Bundlers

Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules \(often hundreds of them\), and combine them together into a few files better optimized for the browsers. Some bundlers commonly used in React applications include [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## Package Managers

Package managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are two package managers commonly used in React applications. Both of them are clients for the same npm package registry.

## CDN

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.

## JSX

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to `React.createElement()` calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”. To get a basic introduction to JSX [see the docs here](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and find a more in-depth tutorial on JSX [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).

React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. For example, `tabindex` becomes `tabIndex` in JSX. The attribute `class` is also written as `className` since `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript:

```text
const name = 'Clementine';
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1 className="hello">My name is {name}!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## [Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)

React elements are the building blocks of React applications. One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are immutable.

```text
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

Typically, elements are not used directly, but get returned from components.

## [Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. The simplest version of React component is a plain JavaScript function that returns a React element:

```text
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

Components can also be ES6 classes:

```text
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

Components can be broken down into distinct pieces of functionality and used within other components. Components can return other components, arrays, strings and numbers. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times \(Button, Panel, Avatar\), or is complex enough on its own \(App, FeedStory, Comment\), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component. Component names should also always start with a capital letter \(`<Wrapper/>` **not** `<wrapper/>`\). See [this documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#rendering-a-component) for more information on rendering components.

### [`props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

`props` are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

Remember that `props` are readonly. They should not be modified in any way:

If you need to modify some value in response to user input or a network response, use `state` instead.

### `props.children`

`props.children` is available on every component. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example:

```text
<Welcome>Hello world!</Welcome>
```

The string `Hello world!` is available in `props.children` in the `Welcome` component:

```text
function Welcome(props) {
  return <p>{props.children}</p>;
}
```

For components defined as classes, use `this.props.children`:

```text
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.children}</p>;
  }
}
```

### [`state`](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class)

A component needs `state` when some data associated with it changes over time. For example, a `Checkbox` component might need `isChecked` in its state, and a `NewsFeed` component might want to keep track of `fetchedPosts` in its state.

The most important difference between `state` and `props` is that `props` are passed from a parent component, but `state` is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its `props`, but it can change its `state`.

For each particular piece of changing data, there should be just one component that “owns” it in its state. Don’t try to synchronize states of two different components. Instead, [lift it up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) to their closest shared ancestor, and pass it down as props to both of them.

## [Lifecycle Methods](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)

Lifecycle methods are custom functionality that gets executed during the different phases of a component. There are methods available when the component gets created and inserted into the DOM \([mounting](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#mounting)\), when the component updates, and when the component gets unmounted or removed from the DOM.

## [Controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) vs. [Uncontrolled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)

React has two different approaches to dealing with form inputs.

An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a _controlled component_. When a user enters data into a controlled component a change event handler is triggered and your code decides whether the input is valid \(by re-rendering with the updated value\). If you do not re-render then the form element will remain unchanged.

An _uncontrolled component_ works like form elements do outside of React. When a user inputs data into a form field \(an input box, dropdown, etc\) the updated information is reflected without React needing to do anything. However, this also means that you can’t force the field to have a certain value.

In most cases you should use controlled components.

## [Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating arrays of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside an array to give the elements a stable identity.

Keys only need to be unique among sibling elements in the same array. They don’t need to be unique across the whole application or even a single component.

Don’t pass something like `Math.random()` to keys. It is important that keys have a “stable identity” across re-renders so that React can determine when items are added, removed, or re-ordered. Ideally, keys should correspond to unique and stable identifiers coming from your data, such as `post.id`.

## [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)

React supports a special attribute that you can attach to any component. The `ref` attribute can be an object created by [`React.createRef()` function](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcreateref) or a callback function, or a string \(in legacy API\). When the `ref` attribute is a callback function, the function receives the underlying DOM element or class instance \(depending on the type of element\) as its argument. This allows you to have direct access to the DOM element or component instance.

Use refs sparingly. If you find yourself often using refs to “make things happen” in your app, consider getting more familiar with [top-down data flow](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

## [Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)

Handling events with React elements has some syntactic differences:

* React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

## [Reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

When a component’s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called “reconciliation”.

# Using Web Components in React

React and [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) are built to solve different problems. Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary. As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use Web Components in React, or both.

Most people who use React don’t use Web Components, but you may want to, especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components.

## Using Web Components in React

```text
class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello <x-search>{this.props.name}</x-search>!</div>;
  }
}
```

> Note:
>
> Web Components often expose an imperative API. For instance, a `video` Web Component might expose `play()` and `pause()` functions. To access the imperative APIs of a Web Component, you will need to use a ref to interact with the DOM node directly. If you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a wrapper for your Web Component.
>
> Events emitted by a Web Component may not properly propagate through a React render tree. You will need to manually attach event handlers to handle these events within your React components.

One common confusion is that Web Components use “class” instead of “className”.

```text
function BrickFlipbox() {
  return (
    <brick-flipbox class="demo">
      <div>front</div>
      <div>back</div>
    </brick-flipbox>
  );
}
```

## Using React in your Web Components

```text
class XSearch extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const mountPoint = document.createElement('span');
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' }).appendChild(mountPoint);

    const name = this.getAttribute('name');
    const url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=' + encodeURIComponent(name);
    ReactDOM.render(<a href={url}>{name}</a>, mountPoint);
  }
}
customElements.define('x-search', XSearch);
```
